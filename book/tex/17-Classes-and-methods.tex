\chapter{Classes and methods}

Although we are using some of Python's object-oriented features,
the programs from the last two chapters are not really
object-oriented because they don't represent the relationships
between programmer-defined types and the functions that operate
on them.  The next step is to transform those functions into
methods that make the relationships explicit.

Code examples from this chapter are available from
\url{http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2.py}, and solutions
to the exercises are in \url{http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point2_soln.py}.


\section{Object-oriented features}
\index{object-oriented programming}

Python is an {\bf object-oriented programming language}, which means
that it provides features that support object-oriented
programming, which has these defining characteristics:

\begin{itemize}

\item Programs include class and method definitions.

\item Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on
  objects.

\item Objects often represent things
in the real world, and methods often
correspond to the ways things in the real world interact.

\end{itemize}

For example, the {\tt Time} class defined in Chapter~\ref{time}
corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the
functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with
times.  Similarly, the {\tt Point} and {\tt Rectangle} classes
in Chapter~\ref{clobjects}
correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.

So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to
support object-oriented programming.  These
features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide
alternative syntax for things we have already done.  But in many cases,
the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the
structure of the program.

For example, in {\tt Time1.py} there is no obvious
connection between the class definition and the function definitions
that follow.  With some examination, it is apparent that every function
takes at least one {\tt Time} object as an argument.
\index{method}
\index{function}

This observation is the motivation for {\bf methods}; a method is
a function that is associated with a particular class.
We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples.
In this chapter, we will define methods for programmer-defined types.
\index{syntax}
\index{semantics}
\index{programmer-defined type}
\index{type!programmer-defined}

Methods are semantically the same as functions, but there are
two syntactic differences:

\begin{itemize}

\item Methods are defined inside a class definition in order
to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.

\item The syntax for invoking a method is different from the
syntax for calling a function.

\end{itemize}

In the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous
two chapters and transform them into methods.  This transformation is
purely mechanical; you can do it by following a sequence of
steps.  If you are comfortable converting from one form to another,
you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.


\section{Printing objects}
\index{object!printing}

In Chapter~\ref{time}, we defined a class named
{\tt Time} and in Section~\ref{isafter}, you 
wrote a function named \verb"print_time":

\begin{verbatim}
class Time:
    """Represents the time of day."""

def print_time(time):
    print('%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))
\end{verbatim}
%
To call this function, you have to pass a {\tt Time} object as an
argument:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time()
>>> start.hour = 9
>>> start.minute = 45
>>> start.second = 00
>>> print_time(start)
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
To make \verb"print_time" a method, all we have to do is
move the function definition inside the class definition.  Notice
the change in indentation.
\index{indentation}

\begin{verbatim}
class Time:
    def print_time(time):
        print('%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))
\end{verbatim}
%
Now there are two ways to call \verb"print_time".  The first
(and less common) way is to use function syntax:
\index{function syntax}
\index{dot notation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> Time.print_time(start)
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
In this use of dot notation, {\tt Time} is the name of the class,
and \verb"print_time" is the name of the method.  {\tt start} is
passed as a parameter.

The second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:
\index{method syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start.print_time()
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
In this use of dot notation, \verb"print_time" is the name of the
method (again), and {\tt start} is the object the method is
invoked on, which is called the {\bf subject}.  Just as the
subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about, the subject
of a method invocation is what the method is about.
\index{subject}

Inside the method, the subject is assigned to the first
parameter, so in this case {\tt start} is assigned
to {\tt time}.
\index{self (parameter name)}
\index{parameter!self}

By convention, the first parameter of a method is
called {\tt self}, so it would be more common to write
\verb"print_time" like this:

\begin{verbatim}
class Time:
    def print_time(self):
        print('%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second))
\end{verbatim}
%
The reason for this convention is an implicit metaphor:
\index{metaphor, method invocation}

\begin{itemize}

\item The syntax for a function call, \verb"print_time(start)",
  suggests that the function is the active agent.  It says something
  like, ``Hey \verb"print_time"!  Here's an object for you to print.''

\item In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active
  agents.  A method invocation like \verb"start.print_time()" says
  ``Hey {\tt start}!  Please print yourself.''

\end{itemize}

This change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious
that it is useful.  In the examples we have seen so far, it may not
be.  But sometimes shifting responsibility from the functions onto the
objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions (or
methods), and makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.

As an exercise, rewrite \verb"time_to_int" (from
Section~\ref{prototype}) as a method.  You might be tempted to
rewrite \verb"int_to_time" as a method, too, but that doesn't
really make sense because there would be no object to invoke
it on.


\section{Another example}
\index{increment}

Here's a version of {\tt increment} (from Section~\ref{increment})
rewritten as a method:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
This version assumes that \verb"time_to_int" is written
as a method.  Also, note that
it is a pure function, not a modifier.

Here's how you would invoke {\tt increment}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start.print_time()
09:45:00
>>> end = start.increment(1337)
>>> end.print_time()
10:07:17
\end{verbatim}
%
The subject, {\tt start}, gets assigned to the first parameter,
{\tt self}.  The argument, {\tt 1337}, gets assigned to the
second parameter, {\tt seconds}.

This mechanism can be confusing, especially if you make an error.
For example, if you invoke {\tt increment} with two arguments, you
get:
\index{exception!TypeError}
\index{TypeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> end = start.increment(1337, 460)
TypeError: increment() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
\end{verbatim}
%
The error message is initially confusing, because there are
only two arguments in parentheses.  But the subject is also
considered an argument, so all together that's three.

By the way, a {\bf positional argument} is an argument that
doesn't have a parameter name; that is, it is not a keyword
argument.  In this function call:
\index{positional argument}
\index{argument!positional}

\begin{verbatim}
sketch(parrot, cage, dead=True)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt parrot} and {\tt cage} are positional, and {\tt dead} is
a keyword argument.


\section{A more complicated example}

Rewriting \verb"is_after" (from Section~\ref{isafter}) is slightly
more complicated because it takes two Time objects as parameters.  In
this case it is conventional to name the first parameter {\tt self}
and the second parameter {\tt other}: \index{other (parameter name)}
\index{parameter!other}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def is_after(self, other):
        return self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int()
\end{verbatim}
%
To use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass
the other as an argument:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> end.is_after(start)
True
\end{verbatim}
%
One nice thing about this syntax is that it almost reads
like English: ``end is after start?''


\section{The init method}
\index{init method}
\index{method!init}

The init method (short for ``initialization'') is
a special method that gets invoked when an object is instantiated.  
Its full name is \verb"__init__" (two underscore characters,
followed by {\tt init}, and then two more underscores).  An
init method for the {\tt Time} class might look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second
\end{verbatim}
%
It is common for the parameters of \verb"__init__"
to have the same names as the attributes.  The statement

\begin{verbatim}
        self.hour = hour
\end{verbatim}
%
stores the value of the parameter {\tt hour} as an attribute
of {\tt self}.
\index{optional parameter}
\index{parameter!optional}
\index{default value}
\index{override}

The parameters are optional, so if you call {\tt Time} with
no arguments, you get the default values.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time()
>>> time.print_time()
00:00:00
\end{verbatim}
%
If you provide one argument, it overrides {\tt hour}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time (9)
>>> time.print_time()
09:00:00
\end{verbatim}
%
If you provide two arguments, they override {\tt hour} and
{\tt minute}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time(9, 45)
>>> time.print_time()
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
And if you provide three arguments, they override all three
default values.

As an exercise, write an init method for the {\tt Point} class that takes
{\tt x} and {\tt y} as optional parameters and assigns
them to the corresponding attributes.
\index{Point class}
\index{class!Point}


\section{The {\tt \_\_str\_\_} method}
\index{str method@\_\_str\_\_ method}
\index{method!\_\_str\_\_}

\verb"__str__" is a special method, like \verb"__init__",
that is supposed to return a string representation of an object.
\index{string representation}

For example, here is a {\tt str} method for Time objects:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __str__(self):
        return '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)
\end{verbatim}
%
When you {\tt print} an object, Python invokes the {\tt str} method:
\index{print statement}
\index{statement!print}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time(9, 45)
>>> print(time)
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
When I write a new class, I almost always start by writing 
\verb"__init__", which makes it easier to instantiate objects, and 
\verb"__str__", which is useful for debugging.

As an exercise, write a {\tt str} method for the {\tt Point} class.
Create a Point object and print it.


\section{Operator overloading}
\label{operator.overloading}

By defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior
of operators on programmer-defined types.  For example, if you define
a method named \verb"__add__" for the {\tt Time} class, you can use the
{\tt +} operator on Time objects.
\index{programmer-defined type}
\index{type!programmer-defined}

Here is what the definition might look like:
\index{add method}
\index{method!add}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
And here is how you could use it:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time(9, 45)
>>> duration = Time(1, 35)
>>> print(start + duration)
11:20:00
\end{verbatim}
%
When you apply the {\tt +} operator to Time objects, Python invokes
\verb"__add__".  When you print the result, Python invokes 
\verb"__str__".  So there is a lot happening behind the scenes!
\index{operator overloading}

Changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with
programmer-defined types is called {\bf operator overloading}.  For every
operator in Python there is a corresponding special method, like 
\verb"__add__".  For more details, see
\url{http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames}.

As an exercise, write an {\tt add} method for the Point class.  


\section{Type-based dispatch}

In the previous section we added two Time objects, but you
also might want to add an integer to a Time object.  The
following is a version of \verb"__add__"
that checks the type of {\tt other} and invokes either
\verb"add_time" or {\tt increment}:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Time):
            return self.add_time(other)
        else:
            return self.increment(other)

    def add_time(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
The built-in function {\tt isinstance} takes a value and a
class object, and returns {\tt True} if the value is an instance
of the class.
\index{isinstance function}
\index{function!isinstance}

If {\tt other} is a Time object, \verb"__add__" invokes
\verb"add_time".  Otherwise it assumes that the parameter
is a number and invokes {\tt increment}.  This operation is
called a {\bf type-based dispatch} because it dispatches the
computation to different methods based on the type of the
arguments.
\index{type-based dispatch}
\index{dispatch, type-based}

Here are examples that use the {\tt +} operator with different
types:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time(9, 45)
>>> duration = Time(1, 35)
>>> print(start + duration)
11:20:00
>>> print(start + 1337)
10:07:17
\end{verbatim}
%
Unfortunately, this implementation of addition is not commutative.
If the integer is the first operand, you get
\index{commutativity}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(1337 + start)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'instance'
\end{verbatim}
%
The problem is, instead of asking the Time object to add an integer,
Python is asking an integer to add a Time object, and it doesn't know
how.  But there is a clever solution for this problem: the
special method \verb"__radd__", which stands for ``right-side add''.
This method is invoked when a Time object appears on the right side of
the {\tt +} operator.  Here's the definition:
\index{radd method}
\index{method!radd}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self.__add__(other)
\end{verbatim}
%
And here's how it's used:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(1337 + start)
10:07:17
\end{verbatim}
%

As an exercise, write an {\tt add} method for Points that works with
either a Point object or a tuple:

\begin{itemize}

\item If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new
Point whose $x$ coordinate is the sum of the $x$ coordinates of the
operands, and likewise for the $y$ coordinates.

\item If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the
first element of the tuple to the $x$ coordinate and the second
element to the $y$ coordinate, and return a new Point with the result. 

\end{itemize}




\section{Polymorphism}
\label{polymorphism}

Type-based dispatch is useful when it is necessary, but (fortunately)
it is not always necessary.  Often you can avoid it by writing functions
that work correctly for arguments with different types.
\index{type-based dispatch}
\index{dispatch!type-based}

Many of the functions we wrote for strings also
work for other sequence types.
For example, in Section~\ref{histogram}
we used {\tt histogram} to count the number of times each letter
appears in a word.

\begin{verbatim}
def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] = d[c]+1
    return d
\end{verbatim}
%
This function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries,
as long as the elements of {\tt s} are hashable, so they can be used
as keys in {\tt d}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['spam', 'egg', 'spam', 'spam', 'bacon', 'spam']
>>> histogram(t)
{'bacon': 1, 'egg': 1, 'spam': 4}
\end{verbatim}
%
Functions that work with several types are called {\bf polymorphic}.
Polymorphism can facilitate code reuse.  For example, the built-in
function {\tt sum}, which adds the elements of a sequence, works
as long as the elements of the sequence support addition.
\index{polymorphism}

Since Time objects provide an {\tt add} method, they work
with {\tt sum}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 = Time(7, 43)
>>> t2 = Time(7, 41)
>>> t3 = Time(7, 37)
>>> total = sum([t1, t2, t3])
>>> print(total)
23:01:00
\end{verbatim}
%
In general, if all of the operations inside a function 
work with a given type, the function works with that type.

The best kind of polymorphism is the unintentional kind, where
you discover that a function you already wrote can be
applied to a type you never planned for.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

It is legal to add attributes to objects at any point in the execution
of a program, but if you have objects with the same type that don't
have the same attributes, it is easy to make mistakes.
It is considered a good idea to
initialize all of an object's attributes in the init method.
\index{init method}
\index{attribute!initializing}

If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you
can use the built-in function {\tt hasattr} (see Section~\ref{hasattr}).
\index{hasattr function}
\index{function!hasattr}
\index{dict attribute@\_\_dict\_\_ attribute}
\index{attribute!\_\_dict\_\_}

Another way to access attributes is the built-in function {\tt vars},
which takes an object and returns a dictionary that maps from
attribute names (as strings) to their values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> p = Point(3, 4)
>>> vars(p)
{'y': 4, 'x': 3}
\end{verbatim}
%
For purposes of debugging, you might find it useful to keep this
function handy:

\begin{verbatim}
def print_attributes(obj):
    for attr in vars(obj):
        print(attr, getattr(obj, attr))
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"print_attributes" traverses the dictionary
and prints each attribute name and its corresponding value.
\index{traversal!dictionary}
\index{dictionary!traversal}

The built-in function {\tt getattr} takes an object and an attribute
name (as a string) and returns the attribute's value.
\index{getattr function}
\index{function!getattr}


\section{Interface and implementation}

One of the goals of object-oriented design is to make software more
maintainable, which means that you can keep the program working when
other parts of the system change, and modify the program to meet new
requirements.
\index{interface}
\index{implementation}
\index{maintainable}
\index{object-oriented design}

A design principle that helps achieve that goal is to keep
interfaces separate from implementations.  For objects, that means
that the methods a class provides should not depend on how the
attributes are represented.
\index{attribute}

For example, in this chapter we developed a class that represents
a time of day.  Methods provided by this class include
\verb"time_to_int", \verb"is_after", and \verb"add_time".

We could implement those methods in several ways.  The details of the
implementation depend on how we represent time.  In this chapter, the
attributes of a {\tt Time} object are {\tt hour}, {\tt minute}, and
{\tt second}.

As an alternative, we could replace these attributes with
a single integer representing the number of seconds
since midnight.  This implementation would make some methods,
like \verb"is_after", easier to write, but it makes other methods
harder.

After you deploy a new class, you might discover a better
implementation.  If other parts of the program are using your
class, it might be time-consuming and error-prone to change the
interface.  

But if you designed the interface carefully, you can
change the implementation without changing the interface, which
means that other parts of the program don't have to change.
