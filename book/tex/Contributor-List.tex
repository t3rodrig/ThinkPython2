\section*{Contributor List}

\index{contributors}
More than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in
suggestions and corrections over the past few years.  Their
contributions, and enthusiasm for this project, have been a
huge help.

If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to 
{\tt feedback@thinkpython.com}.  If I make a change based on your
feedback, I will add you to the contributor list
(unless you ask to be omitted).

If you include at least part of the sentence the
error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search.  Page and
section numbers are fine, too, but not quite as easy to work with.
Thanks!
